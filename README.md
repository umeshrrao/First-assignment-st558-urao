#What do you think being a data scientist is about? 
A data scientist is a professional responsible for collecting, analyzing and interpreting extremely large amounts of data. The data scientist role is an offshoot of several traditional technical roles, including mathematician, scientist, statistician and computer professional.
 
#What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 
 Data scientists determine the questions their team should be asking and figure out how to answer those questions using data
#What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 
Statistics is a mathematically-based field which seeks to collect and interpret quantitative data. In contrast, data science is a multidisciplinary field which uses scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge from data in a range of forms
#How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas? 
I work for SAS institute and have been doing datascience since a long time. Being able to collect large amounts of data and anlayzing it to create various insights is very interesting.
